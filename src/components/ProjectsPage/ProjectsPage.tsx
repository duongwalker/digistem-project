          DigiSTEM is the evolution of FutureMath. The set of these projects and those coming
          afterwards, constitute a long-life pedagogy innovation challenge by energizing the
          Scientific, Technological and Engineering development through powerful innovative
          pedagogies supporting the teaching/learning process in Mathematics.

        <h2>Project description</h2>
        <p>
          The primary context of the DigiSTEM project is STEM education. The main target group of
          the project is engineering education professionals that teach STEM or other similar
          subjects. However, the project results can be applied also for other similar subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of the project is to increase digital and pedagogical competence of HEI educators
          and availability of digital resources in STEM subjects in European HEIs. By increasing
          such competences of educators, it gives them tools and knowledge to redesign their
          teaching and implement digital resources and activities (e.g. learning analytics, digital
          languaging, screencasts, visualizations and intelligent assessment).
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective of the project is to promote innovative utilization of educational
          technology, learning analytics and use of open educational resources (OERs) in online,
          classroom and blended learning, especially in HEIs STEM subjects. The project aims to
          support professional development of HEI educators by increasing their technological and
          pedagogical skills and competence. The objective is to build HEI educators' competence of
          such instructional design that improves studentsâ€™ active learning, self-regulated learning
          and learning engagement with the help of educational technology and learning analytics.

          The scope of the DigiSTEM project is to develop educational resources for teaching STEM
          subjects/courses in European higher education institutions (HEIs). The objective is to
          promote innovative utilization of educational technology, learning analytics and use of
          open educational resources (OERs) in online, classroom and blended learning scenarios,
          especially in HEIs STEM subjects. The project aims to support professional development of
          HEI educators by increasing their technological and pedagogical skills, and competence.
