One of the courses focuses specifically on teaching STEM subjects using various digital resources and tools (e.g. learning analytics, digital languaging, screencasts, visualizations and intelligent assessment).<br><br>
The other course's focus is on pedagogical competencies, which enable the target group educators to plan their educational resources in a way that improves students' active learning, self-regulated learning, and learning engagement with the help of educational technology.<br><br>
Both courses consist of independent micro-modules, from which the educator can choose the ones most relevant to their own needs, or study all of them, if they wish.
The courses are studied independently online. The courses are only available in English.`;

  The objective of the DigiSTEM project was to promote innovative utilization of educational technology, learning analytics, and the use of open educational resources (OERs) in online, classroom, and blended learning, especially in HEIs STEM subjects. The project's goal was to support professional development of HEI educators by increasing their technological and pedagogical skills and competences.<br><br>
  The project was funded by EU under the Erasmus+ Program with reference 2021-1-FI01-KA220-HED-000027535.`;
